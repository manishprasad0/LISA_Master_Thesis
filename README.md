# Master's Thesis at ETH Zurich

My Master's Thesis is about developing a framework to estimate both the merger times and pre-merger sky localizations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) observed by space-borne gravitational wave detectors like LISA. Pre-merger sky localization is particularly challenging due to LISA’s limited movement early in its orbit, which restricts its ability to resolve parameter degeneracies. To address this, we explore classical parameter estimation methods and machine learning techniques to assess the feasibility of early sky localization for MBHBs across different mass ranges. 

Our initial findings suggest that MBHBs with masses around $10^5 M_\odot$ produce sufficiently loud signals during the inspiral phase, making pre-merger localization feasible. This advancement could enhance multi-messenger astronomy by enabling early electromagnetic counterpart searches and pre-merger observational planning.
